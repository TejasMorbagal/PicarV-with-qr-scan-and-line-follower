# Autonomous PicarV with qr scan and line follower

The Project was developed as to illustrate blockchain POC in M2M Economy. The idea is that a autonomous car runs around a track which has multiple stations such as petrol stations, washing stations etc. The autonomous pi-car mounted with a video camera captures the frame from a real time video to recognize the QR Code of different stations. The financial transaction after the service is handleded by blockchain. After completing the transcation by executing a smart contract, the car moves on to the next station and does a similar process.
